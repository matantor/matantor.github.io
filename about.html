<p>I made this site as an experiment. I'm curious about the future and about how different things fit together, from markets and technology to nature and the environment.</p>

<p>I studied environmental economics and management, and I tend to explore ideas through research, deep dives, and tools. Sometimes that takes me into crypto and markets, sometimes into sustainability and ecology, and sometimes into building things with AI.</p>

<p>I've also spent time with nature, freediving, breathwork, and travel, and those experiences shape how I pay attention and make sense of things.</p>

<p>I don't know exactly what this site will become. For now I'm publishing essays and projects instead of keeping everything in my folders. It will evolve as I do.</p>

<p>You can just do things.</p>
