<p>I use this space to think in public. I'm interested in investing, crypto, and the future in general. I'm looking to understand how markets work, how incentives shape them, and how narratives influence what people believe will happen next.</p>

<p>Most of my curiosity comes from trying to make sense of the world rather than trying to predict it, though part of understanding the future is recognizing what might be emerging now and how we might benefit from it if we recognize it early. I'm interested in how technology, finance, and policy interact, and what that could mean for the systems we rely on and invest in.</p>

<p>Outside of markets, I'm drawn to sustainability, circular economy, and the relationship between environment and economics. I care about nature and the sea. In the past I spent more time traveling, freediving, and practicing breathwork. Those influences show up in how I observe and make sense of things: calmly, through attention, without assuming I already know.</p>

<p>I grew up in a small village in the Ela Valley and now live in Haifa in the Bat Galim neighborhood. This site is where I collect and share research, ideas, and thoughts, and where I write things down. Nothing here is final, and I don't expect it to be. If you find something interesting, you're welcome to read along or reach out.</p>
