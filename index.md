I'm Matan, and this site is an experiment.
I'm learning and vibe coding, and I built this site with ClaudeCode. I wanted a place to write about what I'm exploring and to publish deep dives and projects that would otherwise stay in my folders. It's a way for me to think in public instead of hiding everything on my computer.
It's early, and I'm still figuring out what it will become. I'll start with essays and expand as I go.
