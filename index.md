Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm Matan Spector, and this is where I share my thoughts and ideas.

I'm passionate about understanding how the world works – from the mechanics of markets and technology to the broader questions about our future. I believe in thinking from first principles, questioning assumptions, and always staying curious.

When I'm not deep in research or work, you'll find me exploring new ideas, reading, or having conversations with interesting people.

Feel free to explore my blog posts or reach out if you'd like to connect.
